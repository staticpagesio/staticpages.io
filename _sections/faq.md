                <p>Like any software, your Jekyll project does require some technical expertise to address issues that arise
                  from time to time. However, at StaticPages, we are very happy to help you solve any technical difficulties
                  you may run into.</p>
                <p>All you need is to drop us a note and let us 2 or 3 time slots that work best for your schedule. That is
                  it!</p>

                <p>Even with all the guides and documentation available out there, for an unexperienced site owner the process
                  still very tedious, error prone and frustrating at best. Oftentimes technical jargon sets you back or
                  leads to unexpected results wasting your precious time and energy.</p>
                <p>Hey, but you're a lucky one! As one of our customers, you can delegate domain setup and configuration to
                  the expert team at StaticPages. We will take care of an every aspect of the process.</p>

                <p>Open-source (aka. OSS) components bring a lot of intrinsic value to a project of any size, however, being
                  best effort some of these OSS components could be poorly maintained or even abandoned by their authors.
                  Unfortunately this brings risks that usually a site owner would have to either deal with on their own
                  or outsource to a freelancer.</p>
                <p>Luckily, at StaticPages we embrace and contibute to OSS, as well as help our customers to maintain
                  OSS components of their Jekyll projects that are outdated, not working properly, abandoned or need customizations
                  not available otherwise.</p>
