Oops, it might be that you've just found something truly amazing we haven't had a chance to discover yet. We will be flattered make XYZ theme a part of our ever-growing **Themes Gallery**. Even though it would take us some time to validate and adopt XYZ theme to the gallery - your request to support the theme will be prioritized.

Drop us a note where XYZ theme can be found, how soon you might need it in the gallery and we will take care of the rest!
