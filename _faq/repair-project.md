Open-source (aka. OSS) components bring a lot of intrinsic value to a project of any size, however, being best effort some of these OSS components could be poorly maintained or even abandoned by their authors. Unfortunately this brings risks that usually a site owner would have to either deal with on their own or outsource to a freelancer.

Luckily, at StaticPages we embrace and contibute to OSS, as well as help our customers to maintain OSS components of their Jekyll projects that are outdated, not working properly, abandoned or need customizations not available otherwise.
