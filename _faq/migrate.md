We are very excited to offer **Concierge Migrations** for our customers at no additional charge (included in all plans). Our migration experts will take care of all technical details when you move in or out, at no charge for you.

All migrations come with a detailed report of what was done and how for an each step and move your site gracefully to keep downtime (if any) to the minimal.

We assign a temporary domain to your site during the migration and ensure everything works flawlessly before going live.
